/// @title IP3QVerifier
/// @notice Typed EVM verifier surface for P3Q STARK/FRI proofs.
/// @dev    P3Q is the strict-PQ proof system specified in
///         `~/work/lux/papers/pq/pq.tex` §profile-table and implemented
///         by the Rust workspace at `github.com/luxfi/p3q`. The on-chain
///         verifier slot under `PROFILE_QUASAR_STRICT_PQ` MUST hold a
///         contract whose `policyId()` returns the canonical PQ proof
///         policy id (`keccak256("ProofPolicySTARKFRISHA3PQ")`).
///
///         Verifier bodies (the real STARK/FRI verification) are
///         audit-gated and live in the Rust crate `p3q-verifier` (and
///         eventually a generated Solidity verifier). Until that audit
///         lands, the canonical implementation shipped with this
///         package is `P3QVerifierStub`, which is profile-compatible
///         (correct `policyId`) but rejects every proof and emits
///         `AuditGatedReject`. Consumers (bridges, anchors) wire the
///         stub by default and swap in the real verifier via their
///         normal admin path once the audit ships.
///
///         The interface intentionally mirrors `IVerifier` from
///         `luxfi/node/quasar/contract`: `policyId()` is the discriminant
///         that the `StrictPQProfileGate` consumes to admit / refuse a
///         verifier in a given profile slot. `verify` is NOT view here
///         because the audit-gated stub needs to emit a log on every
///         attempted verification; production STARK verifiers MAY
///         implement `verify` as a pure / view precompile call.
///
///         This package is the single source of truth for the P3Q EVM
///         verifier types. Downstream consumers (`luxfi/teleport`,
///         `luxfi/node`, etc.) MUST import from here; redefining the
///         interface locally is a versioning bug.
